# Notes for me:
- Hash map is not type safe
- Map only grows; never shrinks
- Btree, LL, DLL are always heap allocated. This is primarily for cleanup purposes, but also other practical
reasons.
- init = memory comes from user, create = memory is heap allocated
- Nodes are assumed to have only 1 piece of data (i.e., is not assumed to be a list). We use void* instead
of Buffer_t because of this reason, and also because it complicates the API
